This repo is http://github.com/mroam/lasersail and we have more information at https://sites.google.com/a/saintannsny.org/solar-sail-2016/

Here's our live interactive web app! https://rawgit.com/mroam/lasersail/master/index.html 
This is a quickly refreshing link showing the latest app version, but isn't meant for heavy traffic so please don't point any apps at this link that could generated repeated frequent traffic. 
(If that happens, rawgit will throttle us, warn us, and finally kill the link.) This link is a savvy display of the index page and associated "[sketch.js](https://github.com/mroam/lasersail/blob/master/sketch.js)" javascript file which sit in this folder along with this readme.


PS: "http://rawgit.com" is nicely feeding our html file ( https://github.com/mroam/lasersail/blob/master/index.html )
with headers that allow it to include javascript and run online.
