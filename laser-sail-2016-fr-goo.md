Project to design a spacecraft with a sail pushed by laser for traveling to Alpha Centauri
Variables

-- different laser wattages

-- solar sail materials/gemoetries/shapes

-- beyond solar system

-- ...

starter p5 code 
 is live now on [mike's lasersail github](https://github.com/mroam/lasersail/blob/master/index.html)
account instead of google to hold our documents, links, models, etc...

=========== GUI:
Thoughts about what users see; how they understand and control what is going on.
How many of (DJR's) 6 basic drawings can we use for GUI? {first 3 are raw data) (

-- Who/What=portrait; 

-- hoWmuch=chart; Where=map;   

-- When=timeline;

-- How=flowchart/cause&effect (mechanism?); 

-- Why=summary/story/equation/deduction & prediction (/original causality?))

=========== Interactions:

1. Beam width
2. Material variables (strength, reflectiveness, specific heat)
3. Size of solar sail (area)
4. Shape of solar sail (angled as a corner reflector or otherwise)
5. Laser variables (Intensity, frequency, angle of divergence)
6. Time that laser is fired
7. Mass of whole craft

=========== laser-data:

"If you project a typical two-millimeter-diameter laser beam 400 kilometers, or 240 miles (the altitude of Space Station), the resultant beam diameter is about 1 kilometer. … the intensity of the laser beam falls in proportion to its cross-sectional area. In this case, an initial beam of 2 millimeters expanded to 1 kilometer, reducing the intensity by a factor of about 250 billion."

- [ ] http://centauri-dreams.org says "Greg Matloff recently proposed use of Graphene as a material for solar sails*. With an areal density of a fraction of a gram and high thermal resistance, this material would be truly disruptive. Currently existing materials have a much higher areal density; a number crucial for measuring the performance of solar sails." {*Matloff, G. L. (2012).

-- [Stella Pro or iThink software from iseesystems.com](https://www.iseesystems.com/store/products/) for simulating dynamic systems (education prices (603) 448 - 4990; sales@iseesystems.com, 30 day free trial avail;). Hmm, I'm not sure which version of their software we want nor what it costs.

-- Cole C. suggests using "ansys.com" or a ["multiphysics" tool.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiphysics_simulation) (Note: wikipedia page about [CAE (computer aided engineering)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_engineering) lists multiple open-source programs in the purple "CAE Software" box at the bottom of the page. (Press the "[show]" button if the list doesn't show.))
